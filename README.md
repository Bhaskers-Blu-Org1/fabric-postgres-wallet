# Postgre SQL Database as a Fabric Certificate Wallet 

Security on the Hyperledger Fabric is enforced with digital signatures. All requests made to the fabric must be signed by users with appropriate enrolment certificates. Once user is enrolled, Node js application persist certificate in wallet for future usages.

Fabric Node SDKs provide default file system wallet for storing fabric certificate. File system wallet stores user certificate in folders. This approach does not provide required security and flexibility to maintain certificate like generation of new certificate for enrolled users (if any modification to blockchain network) or unregistering user from blockchain. File system wallet also impact scalability as production projects grow.

Fabric Node SDK provides a way to store certificates in Couch DB but not in Postgres. There is not direct provision to store enrolment certificates to Postgres database. Postgres database support SQL and NoSQL data storing and has strong community support. Postgres database provides more flexibility compared to Couch db. Also, PostgreSQL provides cost effective alternative. This pattern demonstrates how to use Postgre SQL db as Certificate Wallet using Nodejs SDK.

At the end of this code pattern, users will understand - how to use postgre sql db as a fabric certificate wallet using node js SDK.

# Flow

![Architecture](images/architecture.png)

1. Hyperledger Fabric network is setup using IBM Blockchain Platform.
2. Configure and deploy Postgre SQL database in container. 
3. Deploy the client application using Fabric Node SDK through which user can communicate with blockchain network.
4. User will register/enroll to the blockchain network as a first step. The generated certificates will be stored in Postgre SQL DB. These certificates will be used to do further transactions with blockchain network.

  > Note: It can take up to 15-20 minutes for the cluster to be set up and provisioned.  

**Create IBM Blockchain Platform Service Instance**

Create [IBM Blockchain Platform Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/blockchain-platform) instance using IBM Cloud Dashboard.

![Blockchain Platform](images/create_IBP_service.png)

## 3. Setup Hyperledger Fabric Network using IBM Blockchain Platform

Follow this [tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/quick-start-guide-for-ibm-blockchain-platform/) to create fabric network using IBM Blockchain Platform. You can decide network components (number of organizations, number of peers in each org etc.) as per your requirement. For example, the blockchain network may consist of two organizations with single peer each and an orderer service for carrying out all the transactions.

**Install and instantiate the smart contract**

This pattern can be executed with the sample chaincode [fabcar.go](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-1.4/chaincode/fabcar/go) or else you can install your own chaincode. Instantiate the chaincode after installation.
You can refer to step 12 to step 14 [here](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/quick-start-guide-for-ibm-blockchain-platform/) to install and instantiate smart contract.

**Download connection profile**

* Under `Instantiated smart contracts` section, click on the three vertical dots for your smart contract. Click on `Connect with SDK` option. 
* Provide the MSP name and Certificate Authority. Scroll down and click on `Download Connection Profile`.

![connection-profile](images/download_connection_profile.png)

* Rename the downloaded json file as connection-profile.json. It will be used in further steps.

## 4. Setup PostgreSQL DB

There are two approaches to set up PostgreSQL DB instance.

* **PostgreSQL as a service on IBM Cloud** - IBM Cloud provides [PostgreSQL DB](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/databases-for-postgresql) as a service. Type postgreSQL in catalog search box on IBM Cloud Dashboard and create PostgreSQL instance. Once service is created, navigate to left menu and create service credentials.

![PostgreSQL Service](images/postgresql-service.PNG)


* **PostgreSQL as Kubernetes container** - PostgreSQL can be hosted on Kubernetes as docker container. 
   - Prerequisites -
      * Working Kubernetes Cluster
      * Basic understanding of Docker
You can provision the Kubernetes cluster on any public cloud provider like AWS, Azure or Google cloud, etc. Refer Kubernetes cluster installation and configuration steps for CentOS [here](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-install-a-kubernetes-cluster-on-centos-7/)
   - To Deploy PostgreSQL on Kubernetes we need to follow below steps:
     * Postgres Docker Image
     * Config Maps for storing Postgres configurations
     * Persistent Storage Volume
     * PostgreSQL Deployment
     * PostgreSQL Service

* Postgres Docker Image -
We are using PostgreSQL latest Docker image from the public registry. This image will provide the functionality of providing custom configurations/environment variables of PostgreSQL like username, password, database name and path, etc.

* Config Maps for PostgreSQL Configurations -
We will be using config maps for storing PostgreSQL related information. Here, we are using the database, user and password in the config map which will be used by the PostgreSQL pod in the deployment template.

File: postgres-configmap.yaml
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: postgres-config
  labels:
    app: postgres
data:
  POSTGRES_DB: postgresdb
  POSTGRES_USER: postgresadmin
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: admin123

```
Create Postgres config maps resource -
```
$ kubectl create -f postgres-configmap.yaml 
configmap "postgres-config" created

```

* Persistent Storage Volume -
To save the data, we will be using Persistent volumes and persistent volume claim resource within Kubernetes to store the data on persistent storages.

Here, we are using local directory/path as Persistent storage resource (/mnt/data)

File: postgres-storage.yaml

```
kind: PersistentVolume

apiVersion: v1

metadata:
  name: postgres-pv-volume
  labels:
    type: local
    app: postgres
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
---    
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: postgres-pv-claim
  labels:
    app: postgres
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
      
```
Create storage related deployments

```
$ kubectl create -f postgres-storage.yaml 
persistentvolume "postgres-pv-volume" created
persistentvolumeclaim "postgres-pv-claim" created
```

* PostgreSQL Deployment -
PostgreSQL manifest for deployment of PostgreSQL container uses PostgreSQL latest(or higher version 10.4) image. It is using PostgreSQL configuration like username, password, database name from the configmap that we created earlier. It also mounts the volume created from the persistent volumes and claims to make PostgreSQL containerâ€™s data persists.
File: postgres-deployment.yaml 

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: postgres
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: postgres
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: postgres
          image: postgres:latest
          imagePullPolicy: "IfNotPresent"
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5432
          envFrom:
            - configMapRef:
                name: postgres-config
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
              name: postgredb
      volumes:
        - name: postgredb
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: postgres-pv-claim
```
Create Postgres deployment
```
$ kubectl create -f postgres-deployment.yaml 
deployment "postgres" created
```

* PostgreSQL Service -
To access the deployment or container, we need to expose PostgreSQL service. Kubernetes provides different type of services like ClusterIP, NodePort and LoadBalancer.
File: postgres-service.yaml
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: postgres
  labels:
    app: postgres
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
   - port: 5432
  selector:
   app: postgres
```
Create Postgres Service
```
$ kubectl create -f postgres-service.yaml 
service "postgres" created
```
## 5. Update connection profile and PostgreSQL credentials

After setting up fabric network and postgreSQL DB as mentioned in step 3 and 4, perform the following steps:
* replace ```server/config/connection-profile.json``` with your fabric network connection profile
* replace ```server/config/local-postgres-config.json``` with your postgreSQL credentials (in case of IBM Cloud PostgreSQL service). Current postgresconfig contains postgreSQL credentials for dockerized postgreSQL.

## 6. Run the application

To run application, first install npm dependencies with cmd ``` npm install```. after installing all dependencies successfully, run app with following cmd ```npm start```. server will start running, visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) for api swagger. 

## 7. API Description 

This Fabric postgres wallet provide following apis:
* **POST user api** - This api is used for registering and enrolling user to blockchain fabric network. Once user is registered certificate is stored to Postgre wallet. Need to do the following changes to request body in order to register user to blockchain network:
```
   org - should be mapped to your network org name. 
   user - user name you wish to register
   pw  - password for user (will be used for authentication of user)
   attrs - this is custom attribute object, where you can add any custom attributes need to be added to certificate and which can be used by chaincode for ACL implementation.
```

* **GET user api** - This api will return all users saved to postgreSQL wallet.

* **GET access-token api** - This api will return JWT token after validating username and password (which we provided while registering user in above POST user api) in postgreSQL wallet. This token is encoded with user information which will be used to retrieve certificate from wallet during invoking transaction on fabric network.

* **GET ping api** - This api will query fabric network using certificate stored in postgreSQL wallet. To execute this api, provide access token in header for authentication as bearerToken. The api will authenticate user based on token and once user is authenticated, it will decode user information (userid, role) from token, then api will retrieve user certificate from wallet based on userid (user id is used as key to store certificate in wallet). Fabric node sdk will use this certificate and connection profile to query/invoke chaincode. 

> Note: In this code pattern, we have installed fabcar chaincode on network, so we are calling  ```queryAllCars``` chaincode function. Please do change this as per your chaincode functions.
